(S)elf (H)osted (A)uction (R)egistration (P)rogram by Andrew Kwashnak (dragonbite@gmail.com)

This project was started as a web-based application for managing auction bidders, acution items, winners and caching out of users.

Being web-based, multiple people can access the application through their browser allowing it to scale to the number of cashiers and recorders.

For me, I did this on a local website and router, only needing Internet access for running credit cards (feature not included, we use our credit card service that had a web interface for processing).

There are 3 primary uses:
  1. Registration - register users with their bidder number. Bidder numbers are unique to the user.
  2. Auction Items - to list and manage items available, categorized as silent or live auction items.  I have had success in having somebody in the Auction while it is working, entering the bidder # and the amount the item has gone for.  Coupled with a seperate person writing down the same information has solved many misunderstandings and possible arguments.
  3. Cash Out - once the item is entered into the system, the bidder can cash out and all items attributed to their Bidder Number will be listed and tallied.  When things run smoothly the data is updated before the person can get up from winning the auction item and walk to the checkout line.

Thank you.

In my setup I had 2-3 people able to register people attending. The process starts with searching for returning people and populating the form if found so that it cuts down the work load.  If the customer is new and not in the system then the cashier can fill out their information.  When done, the person is assigned a bidder number, which we wrote on the back of their pamphlet that contains a list of items, advertisements or whatever.

Auction items are to be imported from a spreadsheet or indivually entered.

When the time comes, the winning bidder's number is entered for the item as well as the dollar amount.  We would do a silent auction first and as people shuffle into the live auction, we gather the forms and enter the winning bidder number and bid amount.

Meanwhile, while the live auction is going on would have one person entering each item won into the database, while another person writes down as they hear it individually.  The reason for the second is that whenever there is a question, having 2 people from different locations in the room verify the same winning bidder and amount has defeated many a possible troublemaker.

Since items are being entered live, so long a the silent auction is entered a person can immediately walk out and cash out.  The system is kept up to date.

For cashing out we would take the bidder's number, recite the list of items won and their winning bid, and provide them with their total.  Use of credit cards ended up being at one machine which cash and checks were accepted at the others.

We also printed on 3-part paper so we could take one section for us to the keep as a receipt, one for them to hold onto as proof of purchase, and one that can be given to any porters that help them with getting items to their car (such as furniture).

This method worked for us for a number of years until we unfortunately stopped this form of fundraiser for the time being.

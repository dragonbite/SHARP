(S)elf (H)osted (A)uction (R)egistration (P)rogram by Andrew Kwashnak (dragonbite@gmail.com)

This is my first project being uploaded into GitHub. Please be patient and only provide supportive help and suggestions. 

This project is for running an Auction application on a local website for users to manage bidders and customer, auction items and their winners as well as cashing out the users of the items they won!

By setting this up on a local PHP & MySQL web server one could have all users and cashiers working on the same database at the same time. Internet access is not required, but could be helpful for running a credit card process through your chosen agency's website or local device.

Hopefully this is something that can be integrated with an IDE for easy development.

There are 3 primary uses:
  1. Registration - to register users with their bidder number. Bidder numbers should be unique to the user.
  2. Auction Items - to list and manage Auction Items, whether they are silent or live auction items.  I have had success in having somebody in the Auction while it is working, entering the bidder # and the amount the item has gone for.  Coupled with a seperate person writing down the same information has solved many misunderstandings and possible arguments.
  3. Cash Out - once the item is entered into the system, the bidder can cash out and all items attributed to their Bidder Number will be listed and tallied.  When things run smoothly the data is updated before the person can get up from winning the auction item and walk to the checkout line.

Thank you.
